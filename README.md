# Document Classification and Clustering "KNN Model"
This project demonstrates the implementation of document classification and clustering using TF-IDF and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) along with KMeans clustering. The goal is to classify and group documents into predefined categories and clusters, providing insights into document similarities and classifications based on their content.

# Project Structure
Data: A CSV file (data.csv) containing document IDs and their corresponding text features.

Models:

KNN Model: Used for document classification.

KMeans Clustering: Used to group documents into clusters.

Preprocessing: The project includes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization.

GUI: A Tkinter GUI is implemented to allow users to classify and cluster documents interactively.

# Features
Document Classification:

Classifies documents based on predefined labels such as "Explainable Artificial Intelligence", "Heart Failure", "Time Series Forecasting", etc.

# Clustering:

Uses KMeans clustering to group documents into clusters based on their content.

# Interactive GUI:

The user can input a document or text to classify or cluster, and the system will output the predicted category or cluster.

The GUI displays classification and clustering results in a scrollable text area.
